## Introduction

[The Genius Square](https://www.happypuzzle.co.uk/products/genius-square.aspx) is a spacial awareness game for children. The game consists of seven, six-sided dice, a `6x6` board, 7 'blocker' pieces, and 9 tetris-like pieces of different shapes.

A player rolls all seven of the six-sided dice:

Each dice is then used to put a 'blocker' piece on the board at the given location:
